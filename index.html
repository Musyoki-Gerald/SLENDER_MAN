    <p class="pl">I exist because you thought of me. Now try not to think of me, you can't, I SEE YOU! My swift extrapolation has strengthened and consolidated the sense of me as a folklore entity, which is a big joke. I am a nightmare and I spread faster, now existing near you and far beyond awful. Since the 16th-century scholars have critically examined me to connect collective, variable, and performance behind my creation, the closest description they have sketched out there is that: I'm an unnaturally tall, thin, spectral man with a featureless white face and a black suit and tie, sometimes shown with long black tentacles and sometimes without. My history and mythology have branched off in various directions since my internet conception in 2009 and I'm here to stay. Are you intrigued by my mysteriously vague, and the multiple published stories that vaguely link me to stalking, kidnapping, brainwashing, and murdering people?</p>
